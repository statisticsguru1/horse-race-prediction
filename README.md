# Horse Race Prediction API

## Overview

This project provides a Django REST API web application that allows users to input historical horse race data and receive predictions based on five different machine learning algorithms. The goal is to offer insights into future race outcomes by leveraging various predictive models.

## Features

- **Predictive Models:** The API uses five different machine learning algorithms to generate predictions:
  - **Logistic Regression (Logit)**
  - **Probit Regression (Probit)**
  - **Decision Tree (DT)**
  - **Random Forest (RF)**
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Django
- Django REST framework
- Scikit-learn
- Other dependencies (e.g., pandas, numpy)
